// Each container will hold animals of similar similar, but different, types.
// Animals that dig and live in the ground
// Animals that move about on the ground
// Animals that swim in water
// Animals that fly above the ground
// Before you write any classes for the above animals, determine the common properties and behaviors that some of them share and define interfaces first.
// Once you believe you have a good set of interfaces, then start creating your specific animal classes and have them implement the appropriate interface.
// Then define classes to represent the containers that will hold various animals. Each container class should have a single property - a list to hold animal instances.
// Lastly, in Main() create one (or more if you like) instances of each type of animal and each container. Then add the animals to their corresponding container.
